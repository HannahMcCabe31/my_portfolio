      "Fueled by my passion for reading, I embarked on a project close to my heart with my current School of Code team â€“ a book tracking app designed to enrich the reading experience. Developed using React, MUI components, and Tailwind CSS, the app will seamlessly melds a user-friendly UI with powerful features. Envisioned as a hub for avid readers, it not only facilitates progress tracking but also uses AI-generated recommendations for a personalized touch. Users can curate an array of bookshelves on their profiles, encompassing favourites, read books, and those on their reading wishlist. Social connectivity is a key element, allowing users to follow friends and gain insight into their literary pursuits. Rooted in the desire to inspire a love for reading, this project aims to foster a community of book enthusiasts while also making reading more engaging and accessible.",

      "During our project week, our team (AsyncAvatars) was assigned the task of creating a comprehensive full-stack application targeting a specific challenge encountered by participants in the School of Code bootcamp - the lack of a centralised bank of resourses. The primary objective was to enhance the overall experience of our fellow bootcampers, emphasising aspects like remote learning, knowledge retention, and fostering collaboration.",

      "This project began during week 3 of the School of Code bootcamp when myself and my team were challenged to create a weather app. I decided to continue developing the app in order to hone my skills in front-end foundations. The weather app now fetches real-time data using user-inputted locations and has an intuitive interface, accurate updates, and a dynamic display based on weather conditions. Future plans include expanding data and refining the user experience.",

      "This project demonstrates my first venture into React, when my team and I decided to create a new tool for classroom behavior management - the Eggcelent Achievements app. When students exhibit positive behavior, their names appear as eggs on the screen, creating a unique reward system. I plan to continue developing this app, introducing a counter for additional positive actions or behaviour throughout a lesson or a day that gradually cracks open the eggs. Stay tuned for more exciting updates!",

    description:
      "This project began in week 12 of the School of Code bootcamp when my team and I began exploring typescript and the realm of console-based gaming. This particular project involved crafting a Hangman game, using ASCII art to visualize the progression in the console. The interactive game plays out through prompts, each urging the player to guess a new letter. Correct guesses reveal the positions of previously chosen letters, adding an engaging layer to the gameplay. While there's still ample room for further refinements in terms of both code and user interaction, I am excited to delve deeper into TypeScript, exploring additional features to make it more entertaining.",

Designed to seamlessly convert currencies, the app is a work in progress, with ongoing efforts focused on refining both its styling and functionality. I'm looking forward to delving deeper into Next.js to continue the development of this app!",
