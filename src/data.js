      "During our project week, our team (AsyncAvatars) was assigned the task of creating a comprehensive full-stack application targeting a specific challenge encountered by participants in the School of Code bootcamp - the lack of a centralised bank of resourses. The primary objective was to enhance the overall experience of our fellow bootcampers, emphasising aspects like remote learning, knowledge retention, and fostering collaboration. ",

      "This project began during week 3 of the School of Code bootcamp when myself and my team were challenged to create a weather app. I decided to continue developing the app in order to hone my skills in front-end foundations. The weather app now fetches real-time data using user-inputted locations and has an intuitive interface, accurate updates, and a dynamic display based on weather conditions. Future plans include expanding data and refining the user experience.",
